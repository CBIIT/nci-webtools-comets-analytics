          COMETS Analytics was designed to simplify meta-analysis at the
          consortia level. Users prepare data input, and then the software takes
          care of checking the data integrity, performs data analyses securely,
          and aggregates results in a standardized format. Further details on
          the vision for implementing the software and the current features
          available can be found{" "}
